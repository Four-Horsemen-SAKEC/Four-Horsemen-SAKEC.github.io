# open-data-portal
A demonstartion of open data portal created for Stanford Datathon following the guidelines laid down by Open Data Campus (https://opendatacampus.com/). The entire project is created in simple HTML, CSS, JavaScript with no frameworks used. 

# Current Status:
A functioning data-portal with all web pages working along with ability to download datasets. 

# Past Versions of Project:
Tried to use node.js (as can be seen in previous commits) as server for datasets. Deployed it on heroku but ran into an error while downloading some files. So reverted back to non node version and deployed on github. Currently no errors

# To Do list:
1. Use JQuery and Ajax to update contents on the page instead of using seperate HTML files for each.
2. Make the Search bar functional.
3. Add a preview dataset function where a user can check the attributes and features of dataset before downloading.
4. Try React 
5. Continously add more datasets
