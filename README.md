# open-data-portal
A demonstartion of open data portal created for Stanford Datathon following the guidelines laid down by Open Data Campus (https://opendatacampus.com/). The entire project is created in simple HTML, CSS, JavaScript with Node used for backend. 

# Current Status:
A functioning data-portal with all web pages working along with ability to download some datasets. Some issues with express.js and node.js to be resolved

# To Do list:
1. Use JQuery and Ajax to update contents on the page instead of using seperate HTML files for each.
2. Make the Search bar functional.
3. Add a preview dataset function where a user can check the attributes and features of dataset before downloading.
4. Try React 
5. Continously add more datasets
